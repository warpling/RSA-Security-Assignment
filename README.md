##Prerequisites
You must alread have GMP installed to compile.
The easiest way to install GMP is to use the bundle manager brew and run `brew install gmp`.
Make sure it installs without errors and if there are errors make sure you don't ignore them and tear our your hair for an hour.

##Basic instructions
To compile each part simply run a cmd like...
`make part3`

Some make targets will also run the compiled executable... so be prepared for that...


##Part 1
Generates 10 probabalistic primes
`make part1`
